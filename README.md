# Javanaise

## IRC
To run the little chat application:
- launch the coordinator (src/jvn/JvnCoordImpl)  
- launch as many servers as you want (src/irc/Irc)  

## Burst Tests
To perform some burst tests on our Javanaise implementation:  
- launch the coordinator (src/jvn/JvnCoordImpl)  
- launch 2 burst servers (src/burst/Burst)  
	- One with argument 0 and the other with argument 1  
- launch the runner (src/burst/BurstRunner)
